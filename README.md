Crypto++ Cryptographic Primitive Combination Simulation
========================================================

Simulation to test the efficiency of several SPECIFIC cryptographic primitive combinations in encrypting SCADA messages, the kind used in power grids.

To compile it is necessary to have Crypto++ 5.6.2 made and installed in the same folder as sim.cpp. Instructions to setup Crypto++ 5.6.2 are available on their wiki page.
